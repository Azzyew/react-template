Welcome to my React template!

# What's in it?

I decided to build this template with what I consider the essential for a production-ready app, so we have tools like:

- Vite
- Vitest
- Tanstack Router
- Tanstack Query
- Axios
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- Zustand
- TailwindCSS
- Radix UI
- Class Variance Authority; clsx; and Tailwind Merge
- Lucide
- DayJS

And all that with a bonus of both dark and light modes and toasts for communication feedback!
